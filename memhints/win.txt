             RenderWare Graphics Example (win): Memhints
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

PURPOSE

The MEMHINTS example demonstrates the usage of the memory hints. All
calls for memory allocations coming from any Renderware libraries will
provide a hint that can be used inside user specified memory functions
given to RwEngineInit. This way, you can specifically tune memory
management for your application. A memory hint contains the following
information: duration, chunkID and the hint flags.

In this example we'll create six memory heaps:
RwMatrixHeapId  - for all RwMatrix objects.
ResizableHeapId - for allocs for which calls to RwRealloc might follow.
FunctionHeapId  - for temporary allocations inside the functions.
FrameHeapId     - for per frame allocation.
EventHeapId     - for allocations with longer duration then per frame, but
                  still not global, that can be per level or some event.
GlobalHeapId    - for all global allocations, happening on and before
                  RwEngineStart which will be free on RwEngineStop.

Note that this kind of memory management is not something we suggest you
use in your game, it's just to demonstrate how you can use memory hints.
You can have a separate memory heap for any RenderWare object (RwMatrix
or RpWorld objects,  or any other). Also, having a heap for all temporary
allocations is useful since it will prevent the memory fragmentation. As
always, memory management is very specific for each application and has
to be organized and tuned for each one.
