               RenderWare Graphics Example (win): Camera
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

PURPOSE

The CAMERA example is used to demonstrate how the camera frustum and 
settings can be altered to change the camera's view.

The example creates two cameras, a main camera and a sub-camera.
Initially, the main camera can see the sub-camera frustum and an example
clump. The sub-camera is positioned to view the clump.

By changing the sub-camera settings via the menu or using the mouse, the
effects of the changes can be seen through the main camera. It is possible
to switch the view so that the example looks through the sub-camera.
