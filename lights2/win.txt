             RenderWare Graphics Example (win): Lights2
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

PURPOSE

The LIGHTS2 example is used to demonstrate the effects of different 
global and local lights on an irregular terrain. 

The terrain is always lit by a low level of "Ambient light" (diffuse
light from all directions).

The "Directional light" (parallel light, as from the sun) can be 
switched on or off and it illuminates the hills and valleys in light
and shade.

The "Point light" (like a spot light) is marked by a circle, and throws
a stronger or weaker light, at a fixed angle, onto the terrain beneath
it. The radius of its beam is adjustable. It is darkest when the radius
is small.


Ambient and directional lights are known as global lights and illuminate 
all of the world.  The point light is known as a local light and it's 
illumination only effects the world sectors contained within its radius.

The position of the point light and it's radius is identified by a colored
circle.

The direction of the directional light is identified by an arrow drawn to
the right of the world.

The world sectors are identified by drawing their bounding box and any 
world sectors which are illuminated by the point light have their bounding 
box highlighted, by being drawn in another color.

To see the effects of the different lights, the directional and point 
light can be switched on and off.  The point light's radius can be 
increased or decreased.  These options can be performed using the menu.  
The point light can be moved between world sectors and the directional 
light can be rotated. These options are performed with the mouse.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
GENERAL CONTROLS

Right mouse button drag         - Allows the point light to be repositioned 
                                  in the world, in the x-z plane. 

CTRL + Right mouse button drag  - Rotates the directional light.

SPACEBAR                        - Toggle menu/help/plain mode.

ESC                             - Quit the application.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
MENU OPTIONS

DIRECTIONAL LIGHT       - Allows the user to turn the directional light on
                          or off.

POINT LIGHT             - Allows the user to turn the point light on or
                          off.

LIGHT RADIUS            - Allows the user to change the radius of the 
                          point light.

FPS                     - Allows the user to read the number of frames per
                          second being rendered (updated every second).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
MENU CONTROLS

CURSOR UP and DOWN      - Select menu item.

CURSOR LEFT and RIGHT   - Modify menu item value or execute associated 
                          command.

Menu shortcut keys      - Modify menu item value or execute associated 
                          command.

Left mouse button drag  - Modify floating point value (if applicable) 
                          otherwise do what you would do in general 
                          controls.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
HELP CONTROLS

CURSOR UP and DOWN      - Scroll a line at a time (autorepeat available).

PAGE UP and DOWN        - Scroll a page at a time.
