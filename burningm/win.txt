             RenderWare Graphics Example (win): BurningM
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

PURPOSE

This example demonstrates a burning man effect.

A simple particle system, using a ptank for the rendering, is animated
using a skinned character as an emitter.

For every new particle emitted, a random vertex is chosen and skinned on 
the cpu, so that particles are created on the surface of the character.

The particle emission code, calculating skinning on the cpu, is using the 
RenderWare skinning functions, using SSE assembly when available to speed 
up calculation.

To get more performance out of that code one could :
- Reorganise the data of the particle system to avoid the data copy used 
  during the skinning would give better cpu performance.
- Use 1 weight skin for the burning character.
- Avoid using the normal as an emittion parameter.

The particle animation code would benefit as well from algorithme 
simplification (removal of the wind, or the friction) and assembly 
optimization. 

With those optimization, the effect could be used in a real game situation.

See src\win\prtwin.c file for details of the implementation.
