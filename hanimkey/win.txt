             RenderWare Graphics Example (win): hanimkey
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

PURPOSE

The HANIMKEY example shows how to register and use an 
RpHAnim custom keyframe interpolation scheme.

A standard RpHAnim animation contains rotations and translations for
the bones of the hierarchy in every keyframe. However, the translations
may be redundant as the bones often stay at a fixed offset from the 
parent bone - only the rotation changes.

This example introduces a new keyframe type which includes only the
rotational animation, and no translations, thus saving memory. To support
the interpolation and streaming of the new keyframe type, a set of
callbacks are registered with the RpHAnim system.

The fixed set of translations are applied to the bones after the animation
has been updated. These are extracted from the RpSkin data based on the
bone-to-skin matrices which give the base pose of the character. On 
start up of the example, this translation is not applied, and the skin
can be seen in a 'collapsed' state.

The rotation-only animation is extracted from a standard animation. Once
created it may be saved and re-loaded using the standard RpHAnim
interface.

GENERAL CONTROLS

SPACEBAR                - Toggle menu/help/plain mode.

ESC                     - Quit the application.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
MENU OPTIONS

FPS                     - Allows the user to read the number of frames per
                          second being rendered (updated every second).

Translate bones         - Applies the bone offsets to the animation. These
                          are extracted from the RpSkin data.
