             RenderWare Graphics Example (win): Lights
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

PURPOSE

The LIGHTS example is used to demonstrate the different lights that are 
available for use in RenderWare.

The lights demonstrated are:
     - AMBIENT
     - DIRECTIONAL
     - POINT
     - SPOT
     - SPOT-SOFT

The parameters of these lights can also be varied interactively using the
controls outlined below.

It should be noted that the changes shown in the light drawing when
the light radius is changed is representational (i.e. 5%) of the actual
light radius.
