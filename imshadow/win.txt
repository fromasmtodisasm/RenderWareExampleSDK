             RenderWare Graphics Example (win): Imshadow
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

PURPOSE

This example demonstrates parallel-projection shadow rendering using 3D 
immediate mode.

A shadow camera is tracked along with the running character, and a
preview of its raster may be seen at the upper right hand corner
of the display.

Every frame, the shadow raster is used as a texture and projected onto
an array of 3D immediate mode triangles based on the world geometry
which are then rendered using a suitable blending mode to produce the
shadow.

The set of immediate mode triangles is limited by a collision
test around the character and further elimination of any triangles
whose projected shadow UVs lie outside the range 0 to 1.

Note: Due to unsupported features, the Software Rasterizer (softras)
      does not render the shadow correctly (it is inverted).

GENERAL CONTROLS

SPACEBAR                - Toggle menu/help/plain mode.

Left mouse button drag  - Adjusts observer camera orientation.

CURSOR UP and DOWN      - Move observer camera forwards/backwards.

CURSOR LEFT and RIGHT   - Move observer camera left and right.

ESC                     - Quit the application.

MENU OPTIONS

FPS                     - Allows the user to read the number of frames per
                          second being rendered (updated every second).

Animation               - Enable/disable animation.

Animation speed         - Adjusts the animation speed, either forwards or
                          backwards in time.

Shadow                  - Enable/disable shadow.

Shadow rendering        - Only available on PlayStation 2.

Shadow projection       - Choose between generic and optimized shadow
                          projection. The optimized projection uses
                          multitexturing to apply the shadow only for
                          those sectors affected by the shadow volume.

Shadow resolution       - Sets the resolution of the shadow raster. The
                          actual resolution is two to the power of this
                          value.

Shadow anti-alias       - Apply anti-alias process to the shadow texture
                          by averaging 2x2 texels down to 1.

Shadow blur             - Blur the shadow texture. Values greater than 1
                          cause this process to be repeated multiple 
                          times. This may have an unacceptable impact on
                          performance.

Shadow zone radius      - Adjusts the radial extent of the shadow     
                          covered by the collision region.

Shadow strength         - Sets black or transparent shadows. This may be
                          negative to give an inverse shadow effect which
                          clearly shows all immediate mode triangles 
                          being rendered.

Shadow fade             - If set to ON, the shadow will fade to nothing
                          at the shadow zone radius, thus hiding the
                          limit of the collision zone while giving
                          a natural looking effect.
