             RenderWare Graphics Example (win): Lightmap
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

PURPOSE

The LIGHTMAP example demonstrates how RenderWare can generate and use
lightmaps to display detailed, static lighting.

This example can load BSPs and DFFs, generate lightmap UV coordinates for
them and illuminate the lightmaps from lights in the scene (which can come
from a DFF).

On load, the example will load example.bsp and example.dff (which contains
lights for this scene). Further BSPs and DFFs may be loaded from the
command-line or by drag'n'drop and they may be saved again from the menu
(see below) after having had lightmaps created and/or illuminated for them.

Typical example use might proceed as follows:
 o start the example
   - the default BSP and DFFs load
 o select Create Lightmaps on the menu
   - lightmap UVs are calculated for most of the objects
     in the scene and blank, checkerboard lightmaps are
     then displayed
 o the scene's objects are saved with their new lightmap UV coordinates
   and other lightmap-related plugin data which has automatically been
   set up
   - example.bsp is overwritten
   - vase00.dff to vase03.dff are created (vase.dff is the original)
 o the camera is moved to view a region of the level and Lighting
   is selected from the menu
   - the lightmaps for the visible portion of the level are lit,
     bit by bit, as you watch
   - they are lit using static RpLights in the scene
   - there are two dynamic lights (one ambient, one point) which
     add on top of this (try toggling Dynamic Lighting)
   - note that one vase (that which does not display a checkboard)
     is vertex-lit rather than lit with lightmaps... due to the
     high vertex count, the results are similar
 o inspect the lightmaps in various rendering styles by selecting
   Render Style and Point Sample
 o view the RpLights in the scene by selecting Draw Lights
   - point lights are circles with crosses
   - directional lights are arrows
   - spotlights are cones
   - the ambient light is drawn as the world's bounding box
 o clear the lightmaps with Clear Lightmaps
   - the lightmaps are returned to the checkerboard state
 o jitter the RpLights with Jitter Lights and select Lighting again
   - RpLight shadows are now softened through jittering
     (look at the lights with Draw Lights again)
 o select Destroy Lightmaps and then Create Lightmaps again
   - lightmaps are created only for those objects now
     in the camera frustum
 o select RpLights and then Area Lights and then Lighting again
   - area lighting is now performed
   - this is much slower than RpLight lighting but produces more
     realistic results with soft shadows and subtle gradients
   - two textures are tagged as emitters, light.png and chamberlight.png
 o save the lightmaps as platform-independent images with Save Images
   - these images will then be loaded when the example next runs, on
     any platform
 o save the lightmaps in a platform-dependent texture dictionary with
   Save TexDict
   - the texdict will then be loaded when the example next runs, on
     the current platform

MENU OPTIONS

FPS                  [F]  - Allows the user to read the number of frames per
                            second being rendered (updated every second).

                            movement
Create Lightmaps     [C]  - Creates lightmaps for the objects in the camera
                            view frustum (destroying any existing ones)
Clear Lightmaps      [X]  - Clears lightmaps to a checkerboard pattern
                            (will create lightmaps first if none exist)
Destroy Lightmaps    [Q]  - Destroys all existing lightmaps
Lightmap Density          - Allows the user to modify the lightmap sample
                            density used when lightmaps are created
