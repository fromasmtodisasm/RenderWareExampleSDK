             RenderWare Graphics Example (win): Mipmap
--------------------------------------------------------------------------


PURPOSE

The MIPMAP example shows a buckyball that can be moved toward or away 
from the camera.

It  demonstrates the use of mipmaps in RenderWare. A clump is loaded
that uses two textures, one that uses auto-generated mipmaps, and one
that uses mipmaps generated from user-supplied mip level images.
For the latter type of texture, each mipmap level image is numbered to 
indicate the level currently displayed (level 0 being the top level).

The text at the bottom right of the window shows the total number of
mipmaps in operation. This number will vary between platforms, the 
maximum being determined by the resolution of the top-level mipmap. 
A sufficient number of mipmap images are supplied to give mipmap 
resolutions down to 1x1.

The example also gives a good illustration of the various texture
blending modes:
  rwFILTERNEAREST
  rwFILTERLINEAR
  rwFILTERMIPNEAREST
  rwFILTERMIPLINEAR
  rwFILTERLINEARMIPNEAREST
  rwFILTERLINEARMIPLINEAR
      including some text at the bottom right of the window.
