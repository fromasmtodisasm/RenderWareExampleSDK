             RenderWare Graphics Example (win): Material-effects
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

PURPOSE

The MATFX1 example illustrates how to use the RpMaterialEffects plugin.
The example shows how to create and manipulate clumps with

1. environment maps
2. bump maps
3. combined bump map with environment map
4. dual texturing
5. single texture with an animated UV transform
6. dual textures each with a separate animated UV transform

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
GENERAL CONTROLS

Left mouse button drag   - Rotates the clump.

Right mouse button drag  - Moves the clump towards or away from the camera.

SPACEBAR                 - Toggle menu/help/plain mode.

ESC                      - Quit the application.
